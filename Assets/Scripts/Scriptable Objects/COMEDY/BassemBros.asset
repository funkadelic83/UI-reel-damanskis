  videoClientID: Fusion
  videoRole: Writer/Producer
  videoDescription: This was a piece I wrote for Fusion's 2016 election coverage
    with Bassem Youssef (the 'Jon Stewart' of the Middle East). It was later repackaged
    as part of the linear TV special, "Muslim Invasion with Bassem Youssef." Several
    videos from the show had 9 million views or more, but this one is my favorite.
